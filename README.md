Temp financial garbage dump. I wonder if I can make this a non-profit org. The best way to learn is from others' mistakes and our own.

## Objective: Humans of New York Style blog posts on people's financial fuck ups but in a humorous light that more or less teaches the reader a lesson (whether they realize it or not). I could also make a lot of useless financial tools like a dummy credit to show how much debt you'd rack up with all the things you can't buy but tried to. Or a loyalty card in Google Pay / Apple Wallet where you can rack up useless points in a gamified way that doesn't actually reward you with anything but dopamine. Maybe it'll highlight how companies influence you to spend on things you don't need.
